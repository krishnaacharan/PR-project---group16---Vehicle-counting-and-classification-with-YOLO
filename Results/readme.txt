The output about the vehicle count and how many moved up and down will be in data.csv file.

The output video I uploaded is slow beacuse my system dont have CUDA installed and it is using CPU, if you want better results you can get cuda on your system and and uncomment line 51 and 52 in vehicle_count.py file
