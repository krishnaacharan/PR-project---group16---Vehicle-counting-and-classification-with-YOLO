We can seperately train our own images with yolo,
but as coco dataset is too large, we can directly use coco.names in our code and this will get us all 80 classes present in coco dataset and we also we are uploading the yolo3-320.weights which contains network weights for yolo, trained using coco dataset.

Videos are those on which we tested.
