As mentioned in data folder, yolov3 trained on coco dataset with its weight is uploaded here
and to run the model we need config file as a parameter in opencv.

You can directly keep these files in one folder together with other files and necessary code is written to import these into out code

Github is not able to recieve larger files .So download the weights file from the below link and keep it in the current folder
